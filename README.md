## Installation

1. **Clone or download the FlaskPort folder**

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure your SQLite database is accessible:**
   - The application expects the database at `../data/FinanceData.sqlite`
   - Update the `DATABASE_PATH` in `app.py` if your database is located elsewhere

4. **Run the application:**
   ```cmd
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## Configuration

### Database Path
Update the database path in `app.py`:
```python
DATABASE_PATH = 'path/to/your/FinanceData.sqlite'
```

### Secret Key
For production use, change the secret key in `app.py`:
```python
app.secret_key = 'your-secure-secret-key-here'
```

## Database Schema Expected

The application expects the following SQLite tables:

### Invoices
```sql
CREATE TABLE Invoices (
    InvoiceID TEXT,
    InvoiceDate TEXT,
    Excl REAL,
    BTW REAL,
    Incl REAL
);
```

### Withdraw
```sql
CREATE TABLE Withdraw (
    Date TEXT,
    Amount REAL
);
```

### KwartaalData
```sql
CREATE TABLE KwartaalData (
    tijdvak TEXT,
    betaling TEXT,
    kenmerk TEXT,
    betaald TEXT,
    Amount REAL
);
```

### DebtRegister
```sql
CREATE TABLE DebtRegister (
    DebtName TEXT,
    Amount REAL,
    UnixStamp INTEGER,
    OriginalDebt REAL
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Withdraws or Important Info page not working"

1. **Check database connection:**
   ```cmd
   python test_db.py
   ```

2. **Run the debug script:**
   ```cmd
   python debug.py
   ```

3. **Reinitialize database:**
   ```cmd
   python init_db.py
   ```

#### "Database not found" error

1. Make sure the database path is correct in `config.py`
2. Run `python init_db.py` to create a new database
3. Check that the `data` folder exists in the parent directory

#### "Template not found" error

1. Ensure all files in the `templates/` folder exist
2. Check that Flask can find the templates directory

#### "Module not found" error

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Make sure you're in the correct directory

### Debug Tools

- **test_db.py** - Tests database connection
- **debug.py** - Comprehensive system check  
- **init_db.py** - Initializes fresh database (no sample data)
- **clear_database.py** - Clears all existing data from database

## Contributing

This is a direct port of the AutoHotkey application. To add features:

1. Add new routes in `app.py`
2. Create corresponding HTML templates
3. Update the navigation in `base.html`
4. Test with your SQLite database

## License

This port maintains the same structure and functionality as the original AutoHotkey application.
