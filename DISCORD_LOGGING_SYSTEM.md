# Discord Logging & Monitoring System for Ozark Finances

## 📊 Overview

This system integrates Discord webhooks with your Flask application to provide real-time monitoring, debugging, and activity tracking through Discord channels. Get instant notifications about system events, user activities, errors, and financial operations directly in your Discord server.

## 📝 What Gets Logged

- **App startup/shutdown** - When the Flask app starts or stops
- **Database operations** - Connection issues, schema changes, backups
- **Configuration changes** - Settings updates, environment changes
- **Performance metrics** - Response times, memory usage, slow queries
- **File system events** - Backup creation, cleanup operations
- **Service health checks** - Periodic system status reports

### **2. User Activity Channel** 👤
- **Invoice operations** - Create, edit, delete, mark paid
- **BTW payment updates** - Quarterly payment changes, calculations
