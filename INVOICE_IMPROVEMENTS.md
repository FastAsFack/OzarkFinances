# Invoice Page Improvements Suggestions

## Core Missing Features

### 1. Individual Invoice Actions
- **Edit/Modify Invoice** - No way to correct invoice details if there's an error
- **Delete/Move to Bin** - Individual row actions for managing specific invoices
- **View Invoice Details** - See full invoice information or download/print individual invoices

### 2. Bulk Operations
- **Multi-select checkboxes** - Select multiple invoices for batch operations
- **Bulk export** - Export selected invoices to Excel/PDF
- **Bulk move to bin** - Move multiple invoices at once

### 3. Invoice Management
- **Add New Invoice** button - Obvious way to create new invoices manually
- **Import Invoices** - Make import functionality more visible on this page
- **Duplicate Invoice** - Copy an existing invoice as template for new one

## UI/UX Improvements

### 4. Search & Navigation
- **Quick search box** - Search by invoice number, amount, or date without opening filters ✅ (Implementing)
- **Recently viewed** or **Quick access** to frequently used invoices
- **Export current view** - Export the filtered results

### 5. Visual Enhancements
- **Status indicators** - Show payment status, overdue invoices, etc. ✅ (Implementing)
- **Row highlighting** - Hover effects, alternating row colors
- **Compact/Detailed view toggle** - Switch between summary and detailed view

### 6. Data Context
- **Related information** - Link to customer info, related transactions
- **Invoice preview** - Quick preview without leaving the page ✅ (Implementing)
- **Notes/Comments** - Add notes to invoices

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Essential)
1. Individual invoice actions (edit, delete, view)
2. Quick search functionality
3. Status indicators for invoice states

### Medium Priority (Important)
1. Bulk operations with multi-select
2. Invoice preview functionality
3. Add new invoice button
4. Export current view

### Low Priority (Nice to have)
1. Recently viewed invoices
2. Invoice duplication
3. Notes/comments system
4. Related information links

## Technical Notes

- Status indicators could include: Paid, Pending, Overdue, Draft
- Invoice preview could be a modal or sidebar
- Quick search should work with existing filter system
- Consider adding a `status` column for payment tracking (separate from bin status)
- Invoice preview might need additional fields in database or file system integration
